# Rhexia (Rhex-I-A)

**Rhexia** is the interpreter for the **RIA** language, which is pronounced like *aria*.

## About RIA

**RIA** stands for **Rhexis Intelligence Artificielle**. 
It is an interpreted programming language developed using **C#** by me, **Rhexis**.

## Current Status

This project is still in development and is primarily for personal use and experimentation. It is not yet complete, but feedback is welcome as the project evolves.

> *Note: As of now, this is mainly a fun project for me to explore lexing, parsing & interpreting.*
